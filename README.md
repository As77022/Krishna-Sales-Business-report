# üéØ OBJECTIVE:
The Krishna store entrusted us with the task of crafting a dashboard that could track and dissect their online sales across every nook and cranny of India.

# THE ROADMAP:
Here's the roadmap we followed, each step a building block toward our goal:

Data connection from SQL database
Data Transformation - In power querry with DAX
Data Loading 
Data Implementation
Report Creation and designing 
# KEY REVELATIONS:
Our journey uncovered some gems of insights:

1. The spotlight shines brightly in three states: Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh.
2. As of so far sale inthe product category, Clothing reigns supreme in terms of quantity.
3. When it comes to payment modes, COD (Cash on Delivery) steals the show.
4. The profit leaderboard is dominated by printers, bookcases, and sarees.
5. September's profit takes a dip, while November emerges as the golden month of profits.

# PROJECT DISCOVERIES:

Our project was a treasure trove of discoveries:

1. We fashioned an interactive dashboard that could decode and analyze sales across the vast expanse of India.
2. Our toolkit included complex parameters to drill down into the data, and we sprinkled in some customization magic using filters and slicers.
3. We forged connections, joined tables, and cooked up calculations to manipulate data, empowering user-driven parameters for visualization.
4. The visual feast included an array of customized wonders - from bar charts üìä, pie charts ü•ß, donut charts üç©, scattered charts, clusters charts, to area charts, all seamlessly orchestrated with filters and slicers!

# IMPROVEMENT:

1. Concentrate marketing efforts and allocate resources more heavily in above three states. Tailor advertising campaigns to resonate with the audience in these regions.
2. Capitalize on this by expanding the clothing product line, introducing new designs, and running promotions or exclusive deals related to clothing.
3. Continue to offer COD as a payment option, but also consider introducing other payment methods to cater to a wider audience, including digital payment options like UPI, credit/debit card payments, and EMI options.
4. Promote above products more aggressively, create bundle deals, or cross-sell complementary products to boost sales of these high-profit items.

This project has been a riveting adventure, fueled by curiosity and a relentless pursuit of knowledge on my data analyst journey. 

I eagerly welcome your thoughts and suggestions as we continue to explore the data universe together. Feel free to add your thoughts and insights in this project.
